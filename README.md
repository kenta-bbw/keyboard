# keyboard


The goal of this project is to help me learn how to get user input. User input is an essential part of any interactive program, and understanding how to properly receive and process user input is a fundamental skill for any Java developer.

The project will include a simple program that prompts the user to input data, such as their name or age, and then displays the input back to the user. The program will use various techniques to get user input, such as the Scanner class and the BufferedReader class.

The project will also provide explanations and examples of how to handle common issues that arise when getting user input, such as handling incorrect input and validating user input.

To make the learning experience more engaging and interactive, the project will include exercises and quizzes that test the user's understanding of the concepts presented in the program. Additionally, the project will include links to external resources that provide further information on getting user input in Java.

By the end of this project, users should have a solid understanding of how to get user input in Java and feel confident in their ability to use this skill in their own Java programs.
